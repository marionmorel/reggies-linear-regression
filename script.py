# Task 1
# Write your get_y() function here

# Uncomment each print() statement to check your work. Each of the following should print True
#print(get_y(1, 0, 7) == 7)
#print(get_y(5, 10, 3) == 25)


# Tasks 2 and 3
# Write your calculate_error() function here


# Task 4
# Uncomment each print() statement and check the output against the expected result

# this is a line that looks like y = x, so (3, 3) should lie on it. thus, error should be 0:
#print(calculate_error(1, 0, (3, 3)))

# the point (3, 4) should be 1 unit away from the line y = x:
#print(calculate_error(1, 0, (3, 4)))

# the point (3, 3) should be 1 unit away from the line y = x - 1:
#print(calculate_error(1, -1, (3, 3)))

# the point (3, 3) should be 5 units away from the line y = -x + 1:
#print(calculate_error(-1, 1, (3, 3)))


# Task 5
# Write your calculate_all_error() function here



# Task 6
# Uncomment each print() statement and check the output against the expected result
datapoints = [(1, 1), (3, 3), (5, 5), (-1, -1)]

# every point in this dataset lies upon y=x, so the total error should be zero:
#print(calculate_all_error(1, 0, datapoints))

# every point in this dataset is 1 unit away from y = x + 1, so the total error should be 4:
#print(calculate_all_error(1, 1, datapoints))

# every point in this dataset is 1 unit away from y = x - 1, so the total error should be 4:
#print(calculate_all_error(1, -1, datapoints))

# the points in this dataset are 1, 5, 9, and 3 units away from y = -x + 1, respectively, so total error should be
# 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 18
#print(calculate_all_error(-1, 1, datapoints))
